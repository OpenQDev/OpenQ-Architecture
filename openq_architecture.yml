      The lambda code is stored in the Ilograph Back-End git repository.

      Each lambda has an assigned function, called a **handler**, which is executed when the lambda is invoked. This function can use other functions in the repository.

      Nearly every function makes use of the *DocumentClient* module in the AWS SDK in order to access data in DynamoDB tables. The *S3* module is used to read from and write to S3, and the *SES* module is used to send emails using SES.
